Global Thermonuclear War

Notes.

Scene 1. (Hacker)

Player is trying to impress a girl by hacking into the school
computer.

Several locations in the school can be visited, introducing some key
characters (sadistic PE teacher, school receptionist, geeky love
interest, gay hacker friend)

Library timing puzzle: period-2 and period-3 cyclers must be in sync,
then you can get into the computer room
- librarian putting books away
- teacher patrolling
- maybe you also have to flip a couple of selectables

On the computer, you have the log of a wardialling run
Dial one of the following: Activision, Mifflin Paper, Stellar Test Prep, Oak Ridge Nat'l Lab
You can try two before being kicked out of the computer room

Somehow as a result of this, you trigger DEFCON 1 by some charmingly retro method,
e.g. blowing a PE whistle in the presence of an acoustic coupler
 (why would this even occur to the player? reference is to Cap'n Crunch...)
 (Maybe the PE whistle could be obtained as a trophy after hassling the PE teacher)

At some point you get contacts for followup/help. Options may include
- go to a nightclub and meet Morph33n (suggested by love interest?)
- go to your allies at the university



Scene 2. (Love interest)

Hacker tries to tell you about his exploits/problems.
You are far more interested in telling him about high school social dynamics.
However when you see he is agitated, you give him Morph33n's number.


Scene 3. (Hacker)
Nightclub.


Scene 4. (Hacker)
University.


Scene 5. (Gay love interest)
Scene 6. (Geeky love interest)
These scenes open up the possibility of alternate companions.

Scene 7. (Hacker)
Choice of companion

On the road, with your companion, pursued by the FBI.
Captured, taken to NORAD: you learn that the computer is self-aware,
has been taught emotion, etc.
Escape from capture.

Find the peacenik Professor (he is very like John Lennon).
Return to NORAD.

Defeat the computer by
- making it fall in love with you
- reasoning it into futility
- asking a serious of mindblowing philosophical questions
- smashing it up with an axe
