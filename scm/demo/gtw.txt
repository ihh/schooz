Global Thermonuclear War

Design principles:
Every choice should "mean something", e.g. be active & intentional (change "Examine Sioxsie" to "Stare at Siouxsie"?) or reveal useful detail
Extra things to play with (at least 3 vignettes should be highly interactive/combinatoric)

Ideas for scoring axes:
Cowardice <--> Bravery
Script Kiddie <--> L33T
Story Mover <--> Compulsive Examiner (# of useless clicks)


Synopsis.

William lives in Schoolville with an overbearing compsci father and a Stepford mother.
Scorned by boys, pitied by girls, his high school days are tormented.
A secret black-hat genius is his only superpower.

William's only friends are:
 a fashion-obsessed physics nerd, Peter;
 a literary bohemian German girl, Kaaren;
 a conscientious objector, David.

This is an alternate reality close to ours, with the Cold War slightly escalated,
so the West is a little more repressive and USSR-like (with hints of "Paranoia").

It turns out this is because the NSA, recruiting Nazi scientists, grew a brain
in a vat that has become self-aware. Soviet spies copied the
technology, and now the "brainframes" live in uneasy awareness of each
others' presence, and a possible third alien brain that they think is
really fucking with them.

It turns out brainframes, unethical hybrid AIs reared by the military,
are homicidal killing machines. (Who knew?) They are insanely jealous
of each others' existence, and instantly murder any other newly-grown
brainframes who are connected to the same network.

William gets caught up in this by eavesdropping on a teacher who has
been recruited by the US brainframe as one of its local spies.




The plot is as follows.

SCENE 1: MEET WILLIAM
1a. POV: William
Breaks into the school library and installs a keystroke capture.
Decides to tell Kaaren or Peter.

1b. POV: Kaaren or Peter
Talks over William's attempts to brag. Tells him about a new nightclub where hackers are cool.


SCENE 2: WILLIAM'S HOUSE
2a. POV: William
Home. Meet the parents. A Rube Goldberg computer in the bedroom:
clunky fingerprint scanner, one-time pad, voice synth, acoustic coupler, etc.
("AdamCad Machine": inspect plaque to get a quote from AdamCad Inc. about infernal machines?)
(Acoustic coupler will be useful later.)

2b. POV: William (on the computer)
Wardialling results: 
Hack into a game company. Play global thermonuclear war AND/OR alien invasion games.
("Narrow that phalanx!" - Martin Amis space invaders? "his most important book")
Can't get into the Oak Ridge game company. Greeted with a mysterious high-pitched tone.


SCENE 3: BACK AT SCHOOL
3a. POV: William
Back at school, the next day. Get back into library. Retrieve keylogging results.
Go to class.

3b. POV: William
Weapons class. (First major hint of alternate universe, apart from minor clues like anachronisms.)
Teacher is describing ceramic pistols.
Clearer signals that Kaaren/Peter friendship could develop into more.
Opportunity to declare sexuality and switch primary focus from Kaaren to Peter (or vice versa).
Some funny looks from teachers.

3b. POV: William
Hanging out with a group of peers.
Awkward attempts at social interaction:
embarrass yourself by speaking up for gay rights, algebra, foreigners, pacifists, etc.
(These conversational opportunities should be presented in a random sequence,
terminating in social ostracization as soon as you speak up,
so that "lawn-mowering" them means deliberately choosing the most craven, least controversial option.)

3c. POV: Kaaren or Peter
(conditional on you not being totally craven)
Decides whether or not they're interested in William.


SCENE 4: CONTACT WITH THE UNDERWORLD
4a. POV: William
Leaving the school, notices black van trailing him.
Decides whether to go to nightclub or hacker meetup.

4b. POV: William
Nightclub. Offered choice of red/blue pill.
Can decline, but it's difficult.

4c. POV: William
Hacker meetup.
Can go dumpster diving or call PBXs.

4d. POV: William
On the way home from hacker meetup/nightclub.

4e. POV: FBI agent (female)
Guarding William in the van.
Some exposition of the main conspiracy.
If William ate the pill, he is acting funny.


SCENE 5: AT NORAD
5. POV: William
Council of ten. Black robes. Oak-paneled walls.
"FBI agent" turns out to be only woman on the council.
One woman, nine men. Men constantly overruling her, accusing her of
harassment, telling her to calm down.
Your choices formulate an elaborate escape plan, against backdrop of expositionary dialogue
among the council.
Female council member can help you escape, or you break out of the infirmary and join a
tour group.


SCENE 6: ON THE LAM
6. POV: William

SCENE 7: THE PROFESSOR'S ISLAND

SCENE 8: BACK AT NORAD
